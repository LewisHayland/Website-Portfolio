# Website-Portfolio
This is my website portfolio to help myself stand out as a programmer.

In this application I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript I used bootstrap to help create the Navigation bar and 
footer in my application as i was struggleing to create on by myself that satisfied my desire. 
When creating this application i have come across many problems and have used Stackoverflow and youtube videos to help myself 
to overcome these probelems, and i expect to have many more issues to overcome. In the future I will be adding more projects 
to this website to show my aptitue for programming and to take pride in my work.
